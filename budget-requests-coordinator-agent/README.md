# Budget Requests Coordinator Agent

A Mastra-powered AI agent that streamlines budget requests and automates approval workflows by intelligently routing requests to appropriate approvers based on amount and category.

## What you'll build

- A budget request coordinator that analyzes employee budget requests
- Intelligent routing to appropriate approvers:
  - **Auto-Approved** for small expenses under $500 (office supplies, meals, etc.)
  - **Department Manager** for routine departmental expenses ($500-$5,000)
  - **Finance Manager** for high-value or strategic expenses ($5,000+, equipment, hiring)
  - **Documentation Required** for requests needing detailed justification or vendor quotes
- Automated budget processing with approval status and next steps
- Budget management workflow with priority classification

## Features

- ðŸ’° **Smart Budget Routing**: Automatically routes requests to the right approver
- âš¡ **Auto-Approval**: Instantly approves small operational expenses
- ðŸ“‹ **Documentation Tracking**: Identifies when additional paperwork is needed
- ðŸ‘¥ **Multi-Level Approval**: Routes to department managers or finance based on amount/type
- ðŸ“Š **Priority Classification**: Classifies requests by priority (low, medium, high)
- ðŸ”„ **Workflow Automation**: Streamlines the entire approval process

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.9.0 or higher
- OpenAI API key
- Basic understanding of Mastra framework

## Quickstart

1. Install dependencies and run locally:

```bash
cd budget-requests-coordinator-agent
npm install
npx mastra dev
```

2. Test the budget request coordinator (agent id is `budgetRequestCoordinatorAgent`):

### Small expense request:
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4111/api/agents/budgetRequestCoordinatorAgent/generate \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"I need $200 for office supplies"}]}'
```

### Departmental request:
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4111/api/agents/budgetRequestCoordinatorAgent/generate \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"I need $2,500 for team training workshop"}]}'
```

### High-value request:
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4111/api/agents/budgetRequestCoordinatorAgent/generate \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"I need $15,000 for new equipment purchase"}]}'
```

The response includes approval status, routing information, and a summary line like `([routedTo] | approved: yes/no | priority: [priority])`.

## How it works

1. **Request Analysis**: The coordinator analyzes the budget request to understand the amount and category
2. **Smart Routing**: Amount thresholds and keywords determine the appropriate approver:
   - Small expenses (< $500) â†’ Auto-Approved
   - Routine expenses ($500-$5,000) â†’ Department Manager
   - High-value/Strategic (> $5,000) â†’ Finance Manager
   - Complex requests â†’ Documentation Required
3. **Approval Processing**: The system processes approvals with realistic timing and provides confirmation details
4. **Next Steps**: Employees receive detailed instructions for completing their budget process

## Budget Routing Logic

### Auto-Approved (Low Priority)

- Department equipment
- Software subscriptions
- Routine operational expenses

### Finance Manager (High Priority)
- Amounts $5,000+
- Capital expenditures (CAPEX)
- Equipment purchases
- Infrastructure upgrades
- Technology investments
- Hiring and contractor costs
- Marketing campaigns
- Software licenses

### Documentation Required
- Amounts $10,000+
- Vendor quotes needed
- Business case required
- ROI analysis needed
- Contract negotiations

## API Endpoints

```

## Troubleshooting

- **Wrong routing**: Check amount thresholds and keyword detection logic in `budget-request-coordinator-agent.ts`
- **Agent not found**: Verify agent registration in `index.ts`
- **No response**: Check server logs and ensure all dependencies are installed
- **OpenAI errors**: Verify your API key is valid and has sufficient credits

## Customization

### Adjusting Amount Thresholds
Edit the thresholds in `budget-request-coordinator-agent.ts`:
- Auto-approval limit (currently $500)
- Finance manager threshold (currently $5,000)
- Documentation requirement threshold (currently $10,000)

### Adding New Categories
Edit the keyword arrays in `budget-request-coordinator-agent.ts`:
- `financeManagerTypes`: For categories requiring finance approval
- `autoApprovedTypes`: For simple expenses that can be auto-approved
- `documentationRequired`: For requests needing additional paperwork

### Modifying Approvers
Update the approval logic in individual agent files to adjust:
- Approver names and titles
- Default approval timeframes
- Next steps and instructions
- Company-specific policies

### Custom Business Rules
Modify the `processBudgetRequest` method in `BudgetRequestCoordinatorAgent` class to implement:
- Department-specific thresholds
- Time-based approval rules
- Project-based routing
- Multi-stage approval processes

## Performance Considerations

- **Response Time**: Budget processing typically completes in 1-3 seconds
- **Rate Limits**: Respect OpenAI API rate limits for production use
- **Concurrent Users**: Scale appropriately for expected employee load
- **Database Storage**: Consider using persistent storage for budget tracking

## Security & Compliance

- **Data Privacy**: Secure handling of financial information
- **Audit Trails**: Log all budget requests and approvals for compliance
- **Access Control**: Implement proper authorization for sensitive budget data
- **Financial Controls**: Ensure alignment with company financial policies
